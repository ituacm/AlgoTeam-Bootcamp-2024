Approach:
    The problem requires generating all combinations of well-formed parentheses for a given number `n`, 
        where `n` represents the number of pairs of parentheses. 
    The approach involves using backtracking to explore all possible combinations of parentheses. 

1. Base Case (if): When both the number of open and close parentheses used (`left` and `right`) equals `n`, a valid combination is formed, and we add it to the result list.

2. Recursive Case (else):
    - If `left` (number of '(' used) is less than `n`, we can add an open parenthesis and recursively call the function with `left + 1`.
    - If `right` (number of ')' used) is less than `left`, we can add a close parenthesis and recursively call the function with `right + 1`. 
    This ensures that we only add a close parenthesis when it will still result in a valid combination.

By backtracking (undoing the last addition by `curr.pop_back()`), we explore all possible valid sequences. 
The recursion continues until all valid sequences are found.

/*
In recursive algorithms, if we passed the `curr` string by value, a new copy of the string would be created each time the function is called. 
This could lead to significant memory usage, especially as the depth of recursion increases. 
By passing `curr` by reference, we modify the same string throughout the recursion, only changing its content as needed. 
This reduces memory overhead and improves performance.

Pass by reference: Memory -> 11.91mb (beats %88)
Pass by value:     Memory -> 16.14mb (beats %16)
